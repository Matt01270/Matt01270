### Hi there :wave: 


I'm Matt, a front-end web developer from the UK based in Ontario, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I really enjoy learning new languages and libraries and have a passion for creating visually stunning websites and have a keen eye for accessabilty and responsive design ðŸ‘€. 

My skills include:

- HTML 
- CSS & SASS 
- JavaScript & React.js  
- RESTful APIs & Firebase
- Git and GitHub 

I'm currently completing a wide variety of projects whilst studying at Juno College of Technology in Toronto (don't be shy, checkout my work so far! ðŸ’»). Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or are interested in working together on something - I look forward to hearing from you ðŸ˜Ž
